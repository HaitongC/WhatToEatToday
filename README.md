# WhatToEatToday
## Introduction
This project is made during Code With Friends Fall 2020, hosted by Mayuko.
This discord bot can give meal suggestions to users who add it to their servers
based on the desiring favor and ingredients they typed in the command.
It is a super simple project, and it only contains general structure of the bot
and it certainly needs improvement later on.
## Technologies
It is written solely in Java by IntelliJ. Although there are many better
languages and environments of writing a discord bot, Java is the language I
know better that I am more confident of using it...
General libraries are downloaded from web.
